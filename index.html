            <div class="textfrom6">
              <h3>1. Lower running costs</h3>
              <p>Price is a contentious issue when it comes to EVs, as the cars have still not reached price parity with their internal combustion engine (ICE) cousins and cost of entry for consumers remains higher.</p>
              <p>However, given <a href="https://www.mynrma.com.au/cars-and-driving/electric-vehicles/owning/maintaining-your-ev" target="_blank">EVs have drastically lower running costs</a>  – due to their simpler maintenance schedule and cheaper refueling – owners can expect this initial excess to be equalled and even surpassed over the lifetime of the vehicle.</p>
              <p>On average, EV owners save from $810 to $1400 each year, providing savings of up to $7000 in just a five-year ownership period.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="textunder">
            <p>Planning on doing a lot of driving? These savings could be even greater, with the average electric car costing just $4 to power per 100kms travelled, versus ICE vehicles which average $14/100km in fuel costs.</p>
            <p>At 20,000km driven each yearly, this is a saving of approximately $2000, meaning EV owners could be saving $10,000 on fuel alone in just five years.</p>

              <h3>2. 2030 Europe Climate Target Plan</h3>
              <p>The European Union’s executive presented its plan to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1599" target="_blank";>reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions</a>  by at least 55% by 2030. This level of ambition for the next decade will put the EU on a balanced pathway to reaching climate neutrality and closer to the previously <a href="https://www.frotcom.com/ro-RO/blog/2020/08/brussels-calling-climate-neutrality-2050" target="_blank">established goal of reducing pollution</a>  by 60% in 2050.</p>
              <p>The new target is based on assessing the social, economic, and environmental impacts, demonstrating that this is a realistic and feasible course of action that will leave no sector of the economy untouched, forcing wholesale lifestyle changes and stricter standards industries.</p>
            </div>

              <h5>A new climate target of reducing emissions by 55% until 2030 will bring the European Union closer to the 2050  climate neutrality goal.</h5>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="textunder">
            <p>Under this new climate target for 2030, European automakers will have stricter pollution standards and rules to help achieve the 55% emission-reduction goal. These tighter rules for the automotive industry will not only improve the environment but also drive economic recovery.</p>
            <p>According to the European Commission, accelerating the pace of emission reductions over the next decade with this new target will not only put Europe on the path to climate neutrality. It will also make the EU business and industry a global pioneer.</p>

              <h3>3. Increased fuel security and infrastructure stability</h3>
              <p>Energy systems can be understood as complex adaptive systems with interconnected, heterogeneous elements; given the complexity of the social and technological dynamics involved, energy issues can turn into security issues.</p>
              <p>In terms of policy, in the wake of the oil crisis of the 1970s energy security has been defined as a stable supply of cheap oil, the main threats to such security being embargoes and price manipulation by exporter countries.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="textunder">
            <p>At present, however, energy security goes well beyond oil supply; it is closely connected to other policy challenges such as climate change, globalization, and energy decarbonization. </p>
            <p>Energy security currently has a range of environmental, social, political, and policy components, though various institutional, national, and individual perspectives differ in the importance they ascribe to each. Such multi-dimensional definition of energy security fully reflects the intricate nature of the modern energy industry and the complexity of modern society as a whole.</p>

              <h3>5. A healthier community</h3>
              <p>When speaking of the environmental benefits of EVs, we tend to focus on greenhouse gas emissions and ethical mining, however they also have much more microscopic benefits – both literally and figuratively.</p>
              <p>The OECD estimates that approximately half of all air pollution in member countries is due to motor vehicles. ICE vehicles produce tailpipe emissions which include unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter – all known carcinogens. ICE vehicles in the Sydney-Newcastle-Wollongong area create <a href="https://www.bitre.gov.au/sites/default/files/wp_063.pdf" target="_blank";>$3billion in health costs every year</a> , with 52 per cent attributable to exhaust emissions.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="textunder">
            <p>While EVs may not be entirely ‘green’ in <a href="https://www.mynrma.com.au/cars-and-driving/electric-vehicles/our-mission/are-evs-better-for-the-environment" target="_blank">their production or if charged from the grid</a> , pedestrians and communities can benefit from vehicles passing by them at a street-level not emitting the harmful chemicals listed above.</p>
